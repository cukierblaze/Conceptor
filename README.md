## About the Project

**![Video](Navigation.mkv "Video")** of navigating through the web interface of the app.

A **Python3**  for finding and adding tour ideas, as well as managing users. Working with **user session**, **user data administration** and **access management**. Storing and **encrypting** sensitive data in the database.

I used the **Flask** framework and the **Bootstrap** library to create a pleasant graphical interface for the application. 

The application stores information in a database using the **SQLite** module in Python. Confidential data is **encrypted** (hashed and salted).

The program works with a user session. When the user is not logged in only part of the functionality is available. User management is only possible with the site administrator.

Initializing the application, when there is no user with administrator privileges in the database, requires creating one.

## Idea
The idea for this app was to collect ideas for new tours from employees of a tour company.  

## Requirements

- Python 3
